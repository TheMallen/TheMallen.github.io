## Blog, get!

This years October Resolution (A *hallowed* tradition), was to actually get on top
of this whole having a blog thing. As you can see, I don't waste any ⏲️
when it comes to those.

I'm super hyped to get started writing some real entries.
I've got all kinds of ideas bouncing around in my brain-meats,
and you can expect to hear my takes on:
- conferences I attend
- problems I solve at work
- the challenges of mentorship
- random nerd stuff (magic cards)
- music
- cat ownership


## How did u make this tho?
This blog was built using [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/), and you should
definitely check it out if you're into all that javascript hullabaloo that the kids
are always talking about.

Speaking of which, I should probably warn you.

```javascript
  export default async function blog() {
    await peopleWhoDontWantToReadAboutJavascriptGoingHome()
    writeCoolContent();
  }
```

There's gonna be, like, a *lot* of JS on this blog. Just sayin'.
